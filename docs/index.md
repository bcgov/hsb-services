# Hosting Services

Hosting Services enables B.C. government and broader public sector (BPS)  to access sustainable hosting infrastructure and services, through the Strategic Transformation and Mainframe Services (STMS) Agreement with ESIT Advanced Solutions, Inc. (ESIT), to support the evolving needs of government clients and citizens.

We are comprised of two separate branches – the Hosting Administrator’s Office (responsible for on-boarding of new entities or services, and deal management), and Hosting Delivery (responsible for ensuring the delivery of the services to ministries).  

The Hosting Services AO, provides strategic contract oversight for the STMS Hosting Services Agreement. The Hosting Services AO is responsible for deal governance structures, contract performance, obligations management, contract management, deal negotiation activities, deal expansion and on-boarding opportunities for B.C. government and BPS clients. The office is the primary liaison between government, BPS clients and the outsourced service provider with respect to strategic relationship management, better planning for technology investments, streamlined processes, ensuring on-going contract benefit realization, continuity through stabilized contract management and overall performance.

Hosting Delivery provides a standardized set of IT infrastructure and related support for applications running on Mainframe (z/OS), UNIX/Linux and Windows platforms.

Hosting Delivery focuses on providing complete service packages rather than acting as a hardware provider. Service packages are provided based on selected criteria to meet client business application requirements.

All Hosting Delivery services include infrastructure management, support and security services. Detailed information about Hosting Services can be found on the OCIO Client Resource Centre.
